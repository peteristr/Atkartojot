# You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".
#
# Important, the first letter should be capitalised and spelt exactly like in the example e.g. "Heads", not "heads".
#
# There are many ways of doing this. But to practice what we learnt in the last lesson, you should generate a random number,
# either 0 or 1. Then use that number to print out "Heads" or "Tails".
#
# e.g. 1 means Heads 0 means Tails
#
# Example Output
# Heads
# or
#
# Tails

# Heads = 0
# Tails = 1
#
# random_h_t = random.randint(0,1)
# print(random_h_t)
#
# game = int(input("Heads or tails? Type 0 or 1 "))
# # game_to_int = int(game)
# print(type(game))
# if game == 0 and game == random_h_t or game == 1 and game == random_h_t:
#     print(f"You win {random_h_t}")
# elif game == 0 and game != random_h_t:
#     print(f"You lose {random_h_t}")
# # elif game == 1 and game == random_h_t:
# #     print(f"You win {random_h_t}")
# else:
#     print(f"You lose {random_h_t}")
